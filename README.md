Family Mod Menu — Full Version 1.2.4
----------------------------------

This mod menu is still undetected as of now,
fully works after being discontinued

How to Use:
1. Download the loader.
2. Launch Red Dead Redemption 2.
3. Open the loader.
4. Once in game, press F4 to open and End to unload cheat.

Notes:
- This version is confirmed working and currently undetected.
- I have access to the source code, and the injection method used isn’t great but it’s free, so expectations shouldn’t be too high.
- Theme support is included, though finding compatible themes can be difficult.
